\section{Introduction}

The rotational evolution of main sequence FGK stars via magnetic braking has
been studied since the late 1960s \citep[\eg][]{Weber, Skumanich}.
These stars appear to lose angular momentum via their magnetised stellar wind.
A convenient feature of this magnetic dynamo-driven angular momentum loss
causes rotation periods to converge to a single rotation-age-colour relation
after around 500 Myrs.
Observation of young clusters reveal a large spread in rotation periods at a
given age and mass, but this spread diminishes over time; older clusters show
a reduced spread.
The theoretical explanation for this convergence of rotation periods can be
understood from the rotation dependence of the angular momentum loss.
Rapid rotators lose angular momentum faster than slow rotators and 500 Myrs of
magnetic braking is sufficient to spin-down the rapid rotators to the same
rotation periods as their originally more slowly rotating fellow cluster
members.
After 500 Myrs, the current rotation period and colour, mass or effective
temperature of an FGK dwarf can be used to predict its age.
This process is called gyrochronology.

Many gyrochronology relations have been calibrated using stars with reliable
ages and rotation periods \citep[\eg][]{Barnes2007, Mamajek2008, Meibom2010,
Angus2015, Vansaders2016}.
The majority of these studies used young open clusters, lacking a sample of
old stars with reliable ages.
The \citet{Angus2015} and \citet{Vansaders2016} studies were able to use new
asteroseismic ages from the \kepler\ spacecraft to calibrate the gyrchronology
relations at late ages.
These studies found that the rotation periods of older stars diverged from the
expected power-law relation.
\citet{Vansaders2016} fit these data with a model in which magnetic braking
ceases after stars reach a critical Rossby number, $Ro$, the ratio of rotation
period to convective overturn time.
The Rossby number decreases with decreasing rotation period since stars spin
down, yet their convective overturn time, $\tau$, is mostly determined by
stellar mass and therefore remains constant.
It is the combination of rotation and convective motion in the outer
convective zone that produces the magnetic dynamo and Rossby number is
therefore a reasonable proxy for magnetic activity.
\citet{Vansaders2016} found the critical Rossby number to be 2.6.
As stars' ratio of rotation period to convective overturn time creep below
this number, magnetic braking appears to cease.
Since the works of \citet{Angus2015} and \citet{Vansaders2016}, further
evidence for a transitioning dynamo was discussed by \citet{...}.

The revised \citet{Vansaders2016} gyrochronology model indicates that
Solar-mass stars cease braking at around Solar age, higher mass stars cease
braking at earlier times and lower mass cease braking at later times.
This mass dependence is built into the Rossby number parameterisation of the
\citet{Vansaders2016} model and describes the observations well.
The \citet{Vansaders2016} model is able to reproduce the data, however these
data are sparse---there are only around \nastero\ FGK dwarfs with
asteroseismic ages and rotation periods---and the data sets used to calibrate
are heterogeneous and are subject to large selection and detection biases.
In order to confirm and refine the \citet{Vansaders2016} model, more data are
needed and specifically more ages of old stars with rotation periods will be
particularly valuable.
Such data are likely to be provided by the \tess, the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite.
Before those data become available however, we can use stars with ages derived
from other methods, not as precise as asteroseismology but numerous, to test
the gyrochronology models and characterise the intrinsic scatter in the
relations.
